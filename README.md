## Getting started

A little demo project which shows how to use libraries like

[Charts](https://github.com/HanSolo/charts/tree/jdk17)

[TilesFX](https://github.com/HanSolo/tilesfx/tree/jdk17)

in combination with JDK 17

Please take a look at the [build.gradle](https://github.com/HanSolo/gettingstarted/blob/main/build.gradle) file to see which imports are needed for
those libraries.
And in addition please also take a look at the [module-info.java](https://github.com/HanSolo/gettingstarted/blob/main/src/main/java/module-info.java) file which contains the
required modules for each library;
